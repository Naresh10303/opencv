The approach made for this:

This script overlays a rectangular pattern image onto a white flag image, simulating natural flag waving. The flag image is analyzed to create a mask of the white area using thresholding and morphological operations. The pattern is resized to match the flag and warped using sinusoidal wave transformations to mimic flag motion. The warped pattern is then blended with the original flag using the mask to restrict it to the flag region. The result is a realistic simulation of the pattern flowing with the flagâ€™s folds, which is displayed and saved as an output image
